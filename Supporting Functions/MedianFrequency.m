function [MedFreq,errormsg] = MedianFrequency(xV,leftcutoff,rightcutoff)
% [MedFreq,errormsg] = MedianFrequency(xV,leftcutoff,rightcutoff)
% MEDIANFREQUENCY computes the median frequency in a frequency range given 
% by 'leftcutoff' and 'rightcuroff' for a given time series 'xV'. 
% The standard periodogram is called to compute the power spectrum assuming 
% frequency=1, so that the largest frequency the power spectrum is computed 
% for is 0.5 if 'rightcuroff' is specified. The lower frequency is given 
% by 'leftcutoff' or 0 if 'leftcutoff' is not specified. The frequency 
% resolution is given by the length of the time series. 
% INPUT 
% - xV      : the given time series
% - leftcutoff: the left cutoff of frequency (to avoid the effect of drifts 
%               in the signal).
% - rightcutoff: the right cutoff of frequency (to avoid the effect of  
%                high frequency elements in the signal).
% OUTPUT
% - MedFreq : The median frequency
% - errormsg: a string of error message in case output cannot be generated.
