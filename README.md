# International Cardiac Arrest EEG Consortium (ICARE) Dataset with Deep Learning
The repository contains the implementation for "Predicting Neurological Outcome in Comatose Patients after Cardiac Arrest with Deep Neural Networks" (Under Review).

## Dataset and Method
We develop a multiscale deep neural networks (CNN-LSTM) using continuous EEG and admission characteristics from a multicenter cohort of more than 1000 cardiac arrest patients. The ICARE dataset contains approximately 58,000 hours of clinical EEG data, demographic information from seven hospitals in Europe and the U.S. 

The seven hospitals were Medisch Spectrum Twente (Enschede, Netherlands), Rijnstate Hospital (Arnhem, Netherlands), Erasmus Hospital (Brussels, Belgium), Yale New Haven Hospital (New Haven, CT, USA), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston MA, USA), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA), and Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston MA, USA).
